- 👋 Hi, I’m @Siebe2003. I'm a coffee addict that uses github purely to roll back on previous commits whenever my code throws atleast 30 exceptions due to continously trying to fix an error.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing functional applications using mostly java, c# or python. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write code that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that doesn't include c++. (Please anything but that!)
- 📫 How to reach me: Nowhere. I'm an introvert and not interested in communicating with others.
